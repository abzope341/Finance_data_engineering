Technical User Story:
Title: Fraud Detection in Credit Card Transactions
As a data engineer,
I want to create a data pipeline for processing and analyzing credit card transactions,
So that we can identify potentially fraudulent transactions and alert the relevant parties.
Acceptance Criteria:
The pipeline should be able to ingest raw transaction data from various sources (e.g., POS systems, online transactions).
The data should be cleaned and transformed into a standardized format.
The pipeline should integrate with our existing data warehouse and business intelligence tools.
The system should be able to handle high volumes of data in real-time.
The system should have robust error handling and logging capabilities.

Business Cases:
Fraud Detection: By analyzing patterns in the transaction data, we can identify unusual activities that may indicate fraud. For example, multiple transactions occurring in a short time frame, transactions from locations far from the cardholder’s home, or high-value transactions can all be red flags.

Merchant Category Analysis: By analyzing transactions based on merchant categories, we can identify popular categories, trends over time, and opportunities for partnerships or promotions.

Customer Behavior Analysis: The transaction data can provide insights into customer spending habits, which can be used for personalized marketing and customer retention strategies.

Risk Management: By understanding the types of transactions that are more likely to be fraudulent, we can adjust our risk models and take proactive measures to prevent fraud.

Operational Efficiency: By automating the process of ingesting and processing transaction data, we can reduce manual effort and increase operational efficiency.

Data cleaning is a crucial step in any data analysis process. It involves preparing the data for analysis by removing or modifying data that is incorrect, incomplete, irrelevant, duplicated, or improperly formatted. Data cleaning use cases for our data schema.

Data cleaning use cases:
Transaction Table
Outliers: Identify and handle outliers in the ‘amount’ field. This could be done using statistical methods (like the Z-score or IQR methods) or domain-specific knowledge.
Temporal Consistency: Check if the ‘date’ of transactions follows a logical order (e.g., a card cannot be used before its issue date).
Date Consistency: Ensure that the ‘date’ field is in a consistent format across all records. If not, convert them to a standard format.
Amount Validation: Check if the ‘amount’ field contains any non-numeric values or negative numbers, which might indicate data entry errors.
Missing Values: Check if any transactions have missing ‘id’, ‘date’, ‘amount’, ‘card’, or ‘id_merchant’ values and decide how to handle them (e.g., remove those rows, fill with a default value, etc.).
Missing Transaction Dates: If the ‘date’ field is missing, it could be problematic for time-series analysis or forecasting. Depending on the business case, you might interpolate the date based on surrounding records, or flag these records for further investigation.
Missing Amounts: If the ‘amount’ field is missing, it could impact revenue calculations. In this case need to consult with the business team to understand why these values are missing and how best to handle them.
Duplicate Transactions: Look for any duplicate transactions (i.e., where all fields are identical) and remove them.

Credit Card Table
Card Holder Verification: Cross-verify ‘id_card_holder’ with the ‘ID’ in the Credit Card Holder Table to ensure consistency.
Card Format Validation: Check if the ‘card’ field follows a valid format (e.g., 16 digits for VISA, Mastercard).
Card Holder Existence: Check if all ‘id_card_holder’ values correspond to an existing card holder in the Credit Card Holder Table.
Card Usage: Identify cards that have never been used for a transaction. This could indicate inactive cards or data discrepancies.
Missing Card Holder IDs: If ‘id_card_holder’ is missing, it could indicate a problem with the card issuance process. These records might need to be flagged for review by the business team.
Missing Cards: If the ‘card’ field is missing, it could indicate a data extraction issue. These records might need to be re-extracted or removed from the analysis.

Credit Card Holder Table
Name Consistency: Standardize the ‘name’ field to a consistent format (e.g., “First Last”) and handle any inconsistencies (like abbreviations, middle names).
Name Validation: Check for any invalid characters (like numbers or special characters) in the ‘name’ field.
Missing Names: If the ‘name’ field is missing, it could impact customer segmentation or personalization efforts. Depending on the business case, you might decide to exclude these records from certain analyses or flag them for further investigation.

Merchant Table
Merchant Category Verification: Cross-verify ‘id_merchant_category’ with the ‘ID’ in the Merchant Category Table to ensure consistency.
Name Consistency: Standardize the ‘name’ field to a consistent format and handle any inconsistencies.
Merchant Category Existence: Check if all ‘id_merchant_category’ values correspond to an existing category in the Merchant Category Table.
Merchant Transactions: Identify merchants that have never had a transaction. This could indicate new merchants or data discrepancies.
Missing Merchant Categories: If ‘id_merchant_category’ is missing, it could impact category-level analysis or reporting. These records might need to be reviewed and manually categorized by the business team.
Missing Merchant Names: If the ‘name’ field is missing, it could indicate a data extraction issue. These records might need to be re-extracted or removed from the analysis.

Merchant Category Table
Category Standardization: Standardize ‘name_category’ to a consistent set of categories.
Category Usage: Identify categories that have no associated merchants. This could indicate unused categories or data discrepancies.
Missing Category Names: If ‘name_category’ is missing, it could impact category-level analysis or reporting. These records might need to be reviewed and manually categorized by the business team.

Across Tables
Referential Integrity: Ensure that all foreign keys in a table correctly correspond to a primary key in another table. For example, ‘id_merchant’ in Transaction Table should exist in Merchant Table.
Temporal Consistency: Ensure that all transactions occur after the card issue date (which would be stored in another table like a Card Issue Table).
Card-Merchant Compatibility: If there are certain cards that are not accepted by certain merchants or certain types of merchants, you can check for any transactions that violate these rules.
